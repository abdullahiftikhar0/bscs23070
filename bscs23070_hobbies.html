    I have a lot of <b>hobbies</b> as well. Such as I am fond of reading books
and I am enchanted by them. They are a great knowledge source
and quite helpful in my studies as this hobby always keeps me one
step ahead of my classmates. I also learn skills in my free time such
as coding and other skills that increase my value and worth.
